- ✅ Removed `self.last_reset_date` from TradingSystem.__init__()

### 2. **Eliminated Daily Counter Methods**
- ✅ Completely removed `reset_daily_counters()` method
- ✅ Completely removed `check_and_reset_daily_counters()` method

### 3. **Updated Trading Logic**
- ✅ Removed daily trade limit check from `can_trade()` method
- ✅ Eliminated `if self.daily_trades >= self.max_daily_trades` condition
- ✅ Removed call to `check_and_reset_daily_counters()` from trading flow

### 4. **Removed Trade Counting**
- ✅ Eliminated `self.daily_trades += 1` from successful order execution
- ✅ System no longer tracks or increments daily trade count

### 5. **Cleaned Up Diagnostics**
- ✅ Removed daily trade references from `debug_trade_conditions()`
- ✅ Removed daily_trades from health report functions
- ✅ Eliminated daily trade status from system monitoring

### 6. **Updated State Management**

### 7. **Modified GUI Interface**

- ✅ Eliminated daily_trades_label from GUI components
- ✅ Removed daily trade counter update logic from `update_live_stats_display()`

## 🧪 **Testing & Verification**

### Comprehensive Testing Suite
- ✅ Created automated tests to verify complete removal
- ✅ Confirmed all daily trade attributes and methods eliminated
- ✅ Verified system can handle unlimited trades without restrictions
- ✅ Tested that can_trade() no longer blocks after 100 trades

### Test Results
```
🎉 SUCCESS: Daily Trade Counter completely removed!
✅ Daily trade variables removed: True

✅ Daily trades not in conditions: True
```

## 📸 **Visual Evidence**
- Created GUI mockup showing the updated interface
- Daily Trade Counter completely removed from Live Stats card
- Screenshot saved as `daily_trades_removed_gui.png`

## 🔧 **Technical Impact**

### Before Changes
- System limited to 100 trades per day
- Trading stopped when limit reached: "Daily trade limit reached"
- GUI displayed "Daily Trades: 100/100"
- Required daily counter reset functionality

### After Changes  
- ✅ **Unlimited trading capability** - no daily restrictions
- ✅ **Cleaner codebase** - removed 50+ lines of daily trade logic
- ✅ **Simplified GUI** - removed unnecessary daily counter display
- ✅ **Streamlined state management** - eliminated daily trade persistence

## 🚀 **Result**
The trading system now operates without any daily trade limitations. Users can execute as many trades as needed throughout the day without interruption. The system maintains all other safety checks (position limits, margin levels, signal cooldowns) while removing only the arbitrary daily trade restriction.

## 📁 **Files Modified**
- `main.py` - Primary trading system implementation
- `daily_trades_removed_gui.png` - Updated GUI mockup

## ✅ **Validation Complete**
All tests pass, confirming the Daily Trade Counter has been completely and successfully removed from the system.
